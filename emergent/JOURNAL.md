Newest last. Every number names its seeds; "1 seed" is not a finding.

## 2026-11-04 tick 1: setup

- **Direction:** train the swarm end to end inside physics instead of writing structural behaviours by hand (`PLAN.md`).
- **Physics (`sim.py`)**, checked by hand tests: a lone bot in the air falls and cannot push itself (no flying); a bot
  on the floor crawls; a single-row arm folds under its own weight even with unbreakable bonds (no bending
  stiffness exists); a two-row (triangulated) arm stays up except its one dangling tip bot; a lopsided T on a
  narrow column tips over as a whole (bots cannot anchor to the floor, so balance matters).
- **Shapes (`world.py`)**: towers, T/L/Gamma cantilevers, arches, stairs, stacked blocks, trees (training);
  mushrooms and Y shapes held out. 128 bots, area 1 per bot, standing on the floor.
- **Smoke run (tiny data, 30 iterations, f_bond 8):** first baseline already informative: **the even sample of the
  target, placed directly with all grips on, does not stand**: footprint IoU 0.92 at placement falls to 0.68
  (val) / 0.58 (held-out) after a 10-time-unit passive hold, 44% / 65% of bots drop by more than 1.5 diameters.
  So simply filling the shape evenly is not enough; there is room for the swarm to find something structurally better.
- Speed: `torch.compile` brings one training iteration (64 control steps x 4 physics steps + 100 hold steps,
  forward and backward) from 3.5 s to 0.9 s on an A100.
